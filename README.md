## Setting up
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flulu5239%2Fview-loggers)
1. Make an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/);
2. Use [this link](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flulu5239%2Fview-loggers) to clone this GitHub repository;
3. In the repository it creates, edit the `middleware.js` file and add a webhook URL between the quotation marks;
4. Your project should be deployed after around 40 seconds, and the `vercel.app` subdomain you get should work.
*Vercel itself might trigger the view-logger by using pages of the website.*
